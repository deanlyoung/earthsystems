						<ul>
							<li><font size="5">The Montana Farm Bureau Foundation (MFBF) serves to facilitate funding for agriculture research, education and community support programs within the state of Montana.</font></li>

					<li><font size="6">Issues:</font>
						<ul>
							<li><font size="5">&#34;Just about everything farmers and ranchers do is energy intensive.&#34; -Bob Hanson, MFBF President</font></li>
							<li><font size="5">&#34;&#133;we maximize the role of agricultural producers in any climate policy, including maximizing the opportunities to reduce and sequester carbon.&#34; -Bob Stallman, American Farm Bureau Federation President</font></li>
							<li><font size="5">Stallman went on to say that taking agricultural taking land out of crop production to grow trees for carbon sequestration is ludicrous, &#34;especially in a time when we need 70 percent more food to feed a hungry world.&#34;</font></li>
							<li><font size="5">&#34;Look at the statistics and you&#39;ll see that temperatures have actually cooled over the past decade. In fact, the warming peaked in 1998,&#34; [Kimball] Rasmussen explained. -CEO for Deseret Power Cooperative, Utah</font></li>

					</li>
					<li><font size="6">They rely on faulty or biased science and sources, such as from the Heritage Foundation.</font></li>
					<li><font size="6">Almost always supports the American Farm Bureau Federation's opinions.</font>
						<ul>
							<li><font size="5">Can you think of any issues that might arise from this situation?</font></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><font size="6">What provisions could you propose to convince the MFBF to support climate/energy legislation?</font></li>
