							<li><font size="5">The results of the study were startling. The low-end estimates were that <b>4,000 to 6,000 Montanans could lose their jobs as a result of Lieberman-Warner by 2020</b>. The benefits of any added jobs from new alternative energy production will be greatly overshadowed by jobs lost in other energy sectors. Additionally, <b>the price of gasoline would increase between 74% and 140% by 2030, and the price of electricity would increase by 96% to 133%</b> during that same time. Senator Joe Lieberman, a co-author of the bill, admitted the legislation would cost &#34;hundreds of billions of dollars.&#34; These <b>costs will be passed down the ladder to Montana families</b> who are already concerned about high energy prices.</font></li>
