						<ul>
							<li><font size="5"><b>To avoid climate catastrophe, greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. must peak in the coming decade, decline steadily, and reach a level close to zero by mid-century.</b> In addition to reducing our own emissions, the U.S. should help developing countries cut carbon and protect themselves from the effects of global warming.</font></li>

					<li><font size="6">Beyond Coal: (from their website)</font>
						<ul>
							<li><font size="5"><b>It&#39;s time to move America beyond dirty coal.</b> Coal provides about half of our electricity and more than 30% of our global warming pollution. From the mine to the plant, to the ash pond, coal is our dirtiest energy source. <b>It causes asthma and other health problems, destroys our mountains, and releases toxic mercury into our communities.</b> Continuing our dependence on coal chains us to dirty energy and prevents us from making the changes we need to bring about a <b>clean, secure energy future.</b></font></li>
							<li><font size="5">In Montana: <b>1.3 million tons of Otter Creek coal</b> proposed for mining; <b>7 other proposed coal mines</b>; <b>3 proposed coal export terminals</b> on the Columbia River to ship Montana coal to Asia markets; and <b>1 railroad proposed</b> to haul the climate disfiguring, health destroying coal out of state and into boilers. If this weren't enough, we have the <b>second largest coal-fired power plant west of the Mississippi River</b> complete with leaking ash ponds that are contaminating local groundwater.</font></li>
