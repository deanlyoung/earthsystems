						<ul>
							<li><font size="5">MGGA is a commodity specific organization primarily representing the interests of wheat and barley growers. <b>We use the contacts and experience gained over the past 50+ years to affect the laws, regulations and rules that we farm by.</b> We, along with the National Association of Wheat Growers and the National Barley Growers Association, have become an influential commodity organization in our state and country. <b>We use that influence to make things happen.</b></font></li>
						</ul>
					<li><font size="6">Policies: (pertaining to climate/energy)</font></li>
						<ol>
							<li><font size="5">MGGA encourages approaching environmental problems and concerns through education and cooperation. (Revised 2010)</font></li>
							<li><font size="5">MGGA opposes environmental mandates by government agencies that are detrimental to production agriculture operations. (New 2010)</font></li>
							<li><font size="5">MGGA believes the burning of residue on agricultural fields is a local issue and should not be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency or the US Department of Agriculture.</font></li>
							<li><font size="5">MGGA supports National Association of Wheat Growers&#39; expansion into biomass advocacy.</font></li>
							<li><font size="5">MGGA is opposed to any climate change legislation until it can be assured that production agriculture will not be put in a negative economic position. (ie â€“ costs in excess of potential income from carbon sequestration) Furthermore, MGGA believes that other major carbon emitting countries should be participating in similar greenhouse gas regulation so as not to put the American farmer at a disadvantage in the global marketplace. Finally, if any climate change legislation is enacted, the US Department of Agriculture should be the controlling authority to promulgate and administer the programs to the producers. (New 2009)</font></li>
							<li><font size="5">MGGA opposes EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) regulation of dust from common agricultural practices. (New 2010)</font></li>
